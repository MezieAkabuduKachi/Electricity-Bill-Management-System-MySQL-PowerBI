# DATA USED
DATA - Electricity Bill Management System Data of 39 rows for the Month of May
DATA ANALYSIS - MySQL
DATA VISUALIZATION - PowerBI

# QUESTIONS
1. What is the average electricity consumption per customer and per address?
2. What is the trend in electricity consumption over time?
3. How many customers have complaints and what are the most common types of complaints?
4. What is the average time it takes to resolve complaints?
5. How many employees are needed to effectively manage the Electricity Bill Management System?
6. What is the average reading per meter and per address?
7. What is the average payment amount per customer and per address?
8. What is the trend in payment behavior over time?
9. What is the average order processing time?
10. What is the total revenue generated from the Electricity Bill Management System?

# SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
1.) The  average electricity consumption was summed up as 311,532 by every customer.

2.) The trend in electricity consumption over time showed that the customers usage/consumption only got higher end higher.

3.) All the customers had complaints but one of the most rampant was that, "The customer service we receive is extremely poor. Paraventure, the electrical wires of a transformer in our society gets stolen. There is little or no effort shown by NEPA when we complain and ask fo solutions/help".	

4.) It took about 137,000 hours which is 5,708 days which is approximately 15 years.

5.) The total number of employees need was 39, but I feel due to the response time more workers are needed.

6.) The average reading per each meter were as follows:
Postpaid- 103844
Prepaid- 101816
Smart Meter- 105872

7.) The average payment by customers was 760646

8.) Most payments were made relatively early as it was the start of a new month, that would be why notably the trend in payment decreased moving towards the middle and end of the month.

9.) The average order processing time was approximately 11,000 hours which is 458 days which is roughly 1 year and 3 months.

10.) The Total Revenue Generated was 760646.

# MY INSIGHTS
Based on the customer complaints I would advise firstly that the people working on resolving their problems should be increased by a lot and I would suggest for the most rampant complaint that the workers in charge should do better to get to know the complaints of their customers and ask their superiors for the neccessary equipment they would need to resolve the problem.

For the Companys' progress, marketing and retention strategies, various customers caught my eye while doing my analysis. Based on their payment snd electricity consumption. I would advise that such customers be maintained properly by the company due to their high payments. The customers were Kayode, Murari, Tutor, Ikem, Ike, Fintech and Dupe.

Based on the customers complaint resolution time i feel the company need much more workers.

Also the order processing time is quite poor if you ask me, i would also like to state to the company to try and work better in that department most possibly hire more qualified personnels to handle the job.

As notice many purchases and orders came at the beginning of the month so i would advise the company to supply much more at the ending of the month so it would be available for the heavy demand beginning of the next month.
